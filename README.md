# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning 

Python program to detect transactions which have a high probability of being fradulent. Uses a data set of ~28,500 credit card transaction and two machine learning algorithms: 
1. Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
2. Isolation Forest Algorithm

Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
